## Encrypted Data Vaults Specification

This specification describes a privacy-respecting mechanism for storing,
indexing, and retrieving encrypted data at a storage provider. It is often
useful when an individual or organization wants to protect data in a way that
the storage provider cannot view, analyze, aggregate, or resell the data.
This approach also ensures that application data is portable and protected
from storage provider data breaches.

We encourage contributions meeting the [Contribution
Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).  While we prefer the creation of issues
and Pull Requests in the GitHub repository, discussions often occur
on the
[public-credentials](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-credentials/)
mailing list as well.
