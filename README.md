### From the [Working Group Charter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vf2CsD9QZstzrd6CJ4WFVHw0WKwwNLHf/view):

> Create one or more specifications to establish a foundational layer 
> for secure data storage (including personal data), specifically
> data models for storage and transport, syntax, data at rest 
> protection, CRUD API, access control, synchronization, and at least a
> minimum viable HTTP-based interface compatible with W3C DIDs/VCs.

> The [Decentralized Web Nodes](https://github.com/decentralized-identity/decentralized-web-node) (formerly known as Identity Hubs), and 
> [Encrypted Data Vaults](https://github.com/digitalbazaar/encrypted-data-vaults) 
> documents will be used as a use case, requirements, and technical input for the
> collaborative effort.
